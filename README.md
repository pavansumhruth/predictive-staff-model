 A predictive model for hospital staff allocation.


# Predictive Staffing Model for Hospitals

This project aims to predict staffing needs in hospitals using historical and real-time data, helping hospitals optimize staff allocation.


## Project Description

Hospitals often face challenges in managing staffing levels, leading to either under-staffing or over-staffing. This project focuses on developing a predictive model that uses historical data to forecast staffing needs. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and real-time data, the model aims to optimize staffing schedules and improve operational efficiency.



## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for model building and pipeline.
- `docker/`: Contains Docker-related configuration files for deployment.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation and reports.


## Goals & Objectives

- **Design and implement** a predictive model for hospital staff allocation.
- **Optimize staff scheduling** based on demand forecasts.
- **Integrate machine learning models** and real-time data sources.
- **Ensure scalability** and integration with hospital systems.
